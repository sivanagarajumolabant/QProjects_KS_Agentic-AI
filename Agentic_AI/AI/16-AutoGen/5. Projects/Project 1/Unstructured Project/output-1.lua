A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. \n2. We will check if the number is less than 2. If it is, then it is not prime.\n3. For numbers 2 and above, we will check for factors from 2 up to the square root of the number. \n4. If we find any factors, the number is not prime; otherwise, it is prime.\n\nHere is the Python code implementing this logic:\n\n```python\ndef is_prime(n):\n    if n <= 1:\n        return False\n    for i in range(2, int(n**0.5) + 1):\n        if n % i == 0:\n            return False\n    return True\n\n# Test cases\ntest_cases = [11, 4, 13]\nresults = {n: is_prime(n) for n in test_cases}\nprint(results)\n```\n\nNow, I will pass the code to the executor agent for execution.' type='TextMessage'
