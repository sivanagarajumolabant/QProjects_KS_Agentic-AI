# DevPilot

## _Pilot your entire software lifecycle from idea to release_

## Overview
DevPilot is an end-to-end solution designed to automate your entire software development lifecycle. This project leverages a modular, graph-based architecture to transform user requirements into a fully deployed solution. It handles everything from collecting user requirements and generating user stories to creating design documents, code generation, security and test reviews, and deployment. In addition, Markdown artifacts for each phase are automatically generated and made available for download.

DevPilot uses a state-driven graph (powered by [LangGraph](https://www.langchain.com/langgraph)) with conditional routing to manage the process. The project also integrates with Redis (optionally hosted externally) for caching and state persistence, and provides a visual workflow diagram of the entire process.

## Features
- **End-to-End SDLC Automation:** Automates every stage of the software development lifecycle—from project initialization to deployment.
- **Graph-Based Orchestration:** Uses a state-driven graph with conditional routing to manage SDLC tasks.
- **Artifact Generation:** Automatically generates Markdown documentation for:
  - Project Requirements
  - User Stories
  - Design Documents (Functional & Technical)
  - Generated Code
  - Security Recommendations
  - Test Cases
  - QA Testing Comments
  - Deployment Feedback
- **Interactive Review & Feedback:** Dynamic review cycles at multiple stages with options to approve or provide feedback with Humman-in-the-Loop.

## Setup Instruction
There are 2 entry point in the application: 1. FastAPI 2. Streamlit UI. Depending on the input passed through the command line, the application will be launched in the respective mode.
- Clone the repo
- Create a virtual environment
- Install the requirements
- Install Docker Desktop
- Pull the Redis image using `docker pull redis`
- Run the Redis container using `docker run -p 6379:6379 redis` (Docker is used to store the state of the graph in Redis)
- Run the streamlit app using `streamlit run app_streamlit.py`
- Run the FastAPI app using `python app_api.py`

Make sure to setup the environment variables in the .env file before running the application for the respective LLMs key.

If you don't want to use the redis locally through docker then flow below steps:
- Inside `src/dev_pilot/cache/redis_cache.py` comment the docker redis client and uncomment the upstash redis client.
- Set the url and token in the .env file.

### 3. Update Workflow Progress

Update the SDLC workflow progress (e.g., moving to the review phase) by providing the next node, status, and feedback. This endpoint updates the workflow state and returns the updated state along with the next node to proceed to. This contains the humman in the loop feedback.

**Request:**
```http
POST /api/v1/sdlc/progress_flow
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "project_name": "Ecommerce Platform",
    "task_id": "sdlc-session-f0b4d555",
    "next_node": "review_user_stories", // next node to proceed to, each iteration will return the next node to proceed to
    "status": "approved", // approved or feedback
    "feedback": "None" // if status is feedback then provide the input
}

### How to Use
- **Start the Process:**  
  Send the "start" request to initialize the SDLC process, which returns a task ID and state.
  
- **Generate User Stories:**  
  Use the task ID from the start process, along with the project requirements, to generate user stories.
  
- **Update Workflow Progress:**  
  With the task ID, update the workflow (for example, by approving or giving feedback on user stories). With each iteration pass the next node to proceed to and the status of the previous node. Status can be approved or feedback. Based on the status the next node will be determined. Once the workflow is completed it will return the end node, which indicates the completion of the SDLC process.

- **Added Postman collection for reference.**
